	<b>Can I lose crypto by staking ?</b>
	<br><br>
	Staking is a way of earning rewards for holding crypto. In few clicks you 
	deposit crypto funds, like on a usual bank account, but created and fully 
	controlled by you. Your keys and crypto belongs only to you, but the value 
	stored in special staking smart contracts, so no one use your private data 
	or have access to it.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Can I withdraw my crypto ?</b>
	<br><br>
	You can choose to withdraw your delegated crypto at any time, but it needs 
	to pass through an unbonding period of 14 to 21 days (depending on chain) 
	before it is available to trade.<br>
	<br>
	<b>What is Validator commission ?</b>
	<br><br>
	Validator commission is a fee charged by the validator for operational costs. 
	The average Validator commission is between 5-10% from total rewards, 
	depending on the chain.
