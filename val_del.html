	<br>
	Blockchain is a database that contains information in the form of interconnected 
	blocks. Blockchain is a distributed database because it is stored on different 
	computers connected to the network. A computer with software code installed on 
	it is called a node. A node that stores a copy of the blockchain ensures the 
	security and reliability of the network.<br>
	<br>
	A blockchain network validator is a node or server that ensures the functioning 
	and security of a distributed computing network. They verify and confirm the 
	legitimacy of transactions, and also participate in the mining or staking process 
	(depending on the blockchain network used).<br>
	<br>
	Validators are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain, thereby 
	ensuring that all data on the network is recorded and stored. Their role is to 
	ensure the integrity and consistency of the distributed ledger, making the 
	blockchain secure, reliable and decentralized.<br>
	<br>
	Proof of Stake (POS) means that you confirm the correct block in decentralized 
	network using your crypto coins. Staking involves validators or delegators who 
	have locked tokens on their contracts, so they can be randomly selected by the 
	protocol at specific intervals to create a block.<br>
	<br>
	After the new block is signed, validators and participants receive a reward, 
	which is evenly distributed in a staking pool. This means that at the end of 
	each validating cycle (or epoch), your stake increases, generating you passive 
	income.
